<p>p.60<br>&#x3000;The <strong>Ko-Yo-Kwan</strong> (Red Leaves Residence).   About ten minutes walk from the temple of Zojoji in Shiba, in a westerly direction, the Ko-Yo-Kwan is situated. Placed on the top of a hill, surrounded by pretty walks, it never fails to attract a large number of people.<br>&#x3000;The Ko-Yo-Kwan consists of two wooden buildings at a short distance from each other, separated by flower gardens.<br>&#x3000;The first (the <em>Norakudo</em>) is devoted to the performance of Japanese operatic music and the <em>No</em> dance, giving the visitor an idea of ancient Japan. All the actors are dressed in the costume of modern China. The stage is not grand, but built after a very primitive fashion. Under the boards of the stage are placed large earthenware vases, and the sound issuing from them, as the posturers stamp on the floor has a very curious but not uploading sound. The walls of the room are not plastered, but ornamented by paintings of pine trees and flying cranes.<br>&#x3000;Performances take place every week, the fee for admittance to front seats being 30 <em>sen</em>.<br>&#x3000;The second building (the <em>Ko-Yo-Kwan</em> proper) is used as a tea house of the highest order and is only patronized by the higher class.</p>

B. 1890. <em>Japan: a Sailor&#x2019;s Visit to the Island Empire</em>. New York: John B. Alden.</p>
<p>p.43<br><strong>CHAPTER V.</strong><br>TOKIO &#x2014;&#x2014; ATAGO YAMA &#x2014;&#x2014; KO YO KWAN &#x2014;&#x2014; SHIBA TEMPLE &#x2014;&#x2014; A MIRACLE.<br>&#x3000;After a few days of rest our Princess, Kuma, was requested to make one of a party to the city of Tokio, which request was graciously complied with, so one fine morning found us all at the Yokohama station, where we took the train for the capital city, some eighteen miles distant. In a few moments after leaving the station the country is gained, and you are at once in rural Japan, which is even more charming than the city.<br>&#x3000;A few miles out of Yokohama we passed a number of extensive shell mounds, which were first discovered when the railroad was being constructed. They are similar to those found in Maine and Florida, but lack the stone implements, either arrows, spear heads or other flint utensils which are found so plentifully in those mounds in the States.<br>&#x3000;Vast quantities of pottery of many shapes and different ornamentations from those now manufactured, were found in the heaps. Strange, that like the West, this land has its unknown and un readable monuments of a lost race. The road leads through a volcanic country, the mountains of which are covered with shrubs and trees.<br>&#x3000;The plains are mostly devoted to rice culture, which is the Japanese staple food. The people are generally poor. The smallness of landholdings (p.44) is said to be the main cause among the agri cultural class. If it is a source of poverty, it is also an incentive to contrivance and industry, and shows what can be done on a piece of land not much larger than a house lot in America.<br>&#x3000;The proprietors will throw up ranges of miniature hills, trace winding paths about their base and to their summit, suggest beetling crags, pur ling streams, and silvery cascades by artistically selecting and arranging stones, and then give life to the scene by wonderful evergreens, gnarled and knotted trees, with here and there patches of brilliant golden and crimson flowers springing up, as it were, to brighten the tiny landscape at the right season of the year.<br>&#x3000;The villages are bright, with scrupulously neat and clean houses, each with its attached garden, and often a tiny pond of gold and silver fish, while the whole is made gay with gaudy flags and brilliant lanterns.<br>&#x3000;Early in the forenoon we arrived at the travel er&#x2019;s Mecca, the city of Tokio, the capital of this Island Empire.<br>&#x3000;Our guide soon engaged jinrikishas and men to take us about to see the wonders in the chief city of this eastern land. The city, which is over nine miles in length and eight in breadth, is built on an immense plain, so that the eye could at a glance survey the whole space if the vision would permit, and at every turn there would open to view new features in landscape, water, castles and massive edifices with which this prairie city of the Flowery land, is everywhere studded.<br>&#x3000;Although so much has been written about this Yedo of the past, it is in reality not an ancient city, but can claim an antiquity dating back no further than 1600, when it contained only one small castle surrounded by a few scattering villages spread about upon its flat, even surface. (p.45)<br>&#x3000;These were inhabited by farmers and fishermen, whose produce and catch were conveyed into the interior for sale.<br>&#x3000;In 1604 it began to gain prominence, as at that date the first Shogun (Prince) of the Tokugawa family made it his capital. His successor was his grandson, the noted Iyemitsu, who greatly improved the place and set in motion the ball which rolled on until Tokio became the largest and most populous city of this eastern kingdom. In 1868 the rule of the Shogunate was overthrown, and it then became the capital of the whole Em pire. This plain was formerly called Kwanto, meaning eastern barrier, and it was here that the troops of many different rulers were mustered, drilled and stationed, during their reign, to pre vent the hordes of eastern people from spreading over this portion of Japan, as each Daimio or petty ruler was very jealous of any encroachment upon his territory or rights.<br>&#x3000;But while I have been learning the early his tory of Japan, or rather Tokio, our jinrikisha men have brought us to the foot of a long flight of stone steps, leading to the summit of Atago Yama, a noted eminence near the temple Shiba.<br>&#x3000;The flight of steps leading straight to the top is chosen, and we commence the ascent of the many hundred, which are so nearly perpendicular that a small chain secured to iron posts in the granite is gladly caught hold of to help us up this steep incline. As we sink into a seat when once we have scaled the summit, and cast our eyes about, we feel well repaid for the trouble and toil as in silence we gaze at the wonderful panorama which lies in beauty in and about the vast plain beneath. Here we found the ubiquitous tea house girls, who quickly relieved our fatigue by a cup of refreshing tea, in which was an infusion of salted (p.46) cherry blossoms, much more refreshing than palatable. Etiquette requires you to take the cup whether you drink the contents or not.<br>&#x3000;Towards the bay is a magnificent view of the forts, warships, and numerous fishing craft plying in and out of the many creeks, while to the south is the fishermen&#x2019;s city, called Shinagawa, where thousands of excursionists go to gather shell fish and oysters, which are plentiful on the long stretch of beach uncovered at low tide.<br>&#x3000;The streets are lined with maple trees, making a bright green line among the brown straw-roofed huts. From the western side, a view of the Hakone mountains can be obtained, while in majesty above them rises sacred Fusi Yama, the pride of Japan. The trees about Ueno park show like a forest in the middle of this sea of houses, and mark the plain with an additional beauty. From here the royal residence and castle is seen very plainly. To the northwest is the section of the city called Tskiji, which includes the foreign settlement of Tokio.<br>&#x3000;The engineering college and the buildings of the foreign legation rise grandly above those of the natives, among which they are built, that of the Russians being of such size and height as to show all over the city.<br>&#x3000;On the extreme top of this mount is a Shinto shrine containing a god, supposed to protect against fire. Carved on stone and under the same roof, are representations of the Goddess Benten (of beauty), the gods Ebisu (of happiness) and Daikoku (of wealth), the work being well executed. The 24th of each month the people take as a day for recreation, when they visit this shrine to ad mire the scenery and worship in the temple.<br>&#x3000;As one gazes upon the city below, he is struck by the many small rivers, wide canals, and moats winding about in all parts and in all directions. (p.47) Flocks of wild ducks and other birds could be seen gliding about the canals or flying over head, seemingly unconscious of the thousands of people who lined the banks. Fish are said to be abundant in the moats and streams, but as the people are not allowed to catch them, or to shoot the birds, they are of no benefit.<br>&#x3000;We gave a few cents to the tea house girls, or attendants, and as many more to the presiding god of the temple, when we descended from our elevation by another flight of steps winding about the cliffs so that the ascent or descent is much easier, and is used for old men and women; we found we had become quite old enough to take advantage of them.<br>&#x3000;From the street we followed our guide to the celebrated Ko Yo Kwan, Ko Yo, meaning red maple leaves, and Kwan (pronounced can) a building or club house owned by the nobles of Tokio. It consists of two modern buildings, which are situated on the top of a hill and surrounded by pretty walks and plots of flowers tastefully and artistically laid out; all this cannot fail to attract many visitors where they all seem to admire the beautiful so much. The first building we entered was used as a tea and lunch house of the first class, and patronized only by the nobles of the highest order.<br>&#x3000;Everything in the building, which contained many rooms, was decorated with maple leaves in the different stages of their coloring, but most of them were in the color of those beautified by the first frosts of autumn. The ceiling overhead as well as the sides, the thick mats at our feet, the doors, panels, and paper windows, the brasier of coals, the cups for tea, and the trays on which the cups were passed, the tea-pot and tea canister, the musical instruments and articles of amusement, as well as the dresses of the attendants were decorated with the maple leaf, of so elegant a design, that one could not help thinking of the beauties of our northern home, when our forests are resplendent with the beautiful foliage of this tree. (p.48)<br>&#x3000;Crossing a garden of flowers which separates the two buildings, we entered the second, which is devoted to the performance of Japanese opera tic music, and the celebrated &#x201C;No&#x201D; dance, illustrating an ancient legend of the customs of the Japanese people. The stage is very plain, but no doubt suitable for the performances.<br>&#x3000;Under the boards of the stage are placed huge earthenware vases, from which a peculiar sound issues as the floor is stamped upon, it being both curious and pleasing. The walls, which are ceiled with wide boards, are ornamented with paintings, chiefly representations of pine trees, storks, and flying cranes. Here the Mikado often comes to witness a new play, and we were allowed to draw apart the curtain and gaze at the divan of His Imperial Highness, and all the paraphernalia of his private box.<br>&#x3000;The whole, which was neat and comfortable, was modest and inexpensive, not at all as one would suppose or expect to find any place ever honored by an Eastern Potentate. The rooms were cared for by a young lady of the nobility, but who did not let the dignity of high birth overcome her ideas of ladyship, as she was gracious and attentive in all her manners. On leaving the place we were offered a cup of tea, and accompanying sweetmeats, and given a card upon which a cluster of maple leaves was printed in colors, as a reminder of our visit. From the club house we directed our steps to Shiba, which is well called the &#x201C;Garden of Tokio.&#x201D; Pretty gardens full of flowers and ever greens are seen in all directions. The roads, (p.49) which are wide and clean, are planted on both sides with massive evergreen trees affording a delightful shade. At every turn, priests in their sacerdotal robes, and with shaven heads, are met, who gladly avail themselves of a chance to earn a penny by showing you about the temple grounds, and the tombs of the illustrious Shoguns, which are noted for the magnificence and rich ness displayed in their architecture.<br>&#x3000;The grounds are very extensive, containing many acres. It must be remembered that a Japanese temple is not one compact building, but consists of many separate ones within a compound or garden. The Shiba temple comprises many parts, each governed by different priests and entirely distinct from the others, except that they are contained in one enclosure, dedicated to Shiba. The principal building is usually larger than the others and more elaborately finished.</p>

<p>p.96<br><strong>CHAPTER X</strong><br>THE JAPANESE THEATRE<br>&#x3000;&#x201C;Saturated with the refinements of an old civilization,&#x201D; as Dr. Dresser says, and possessing all other arts in perfection, it is not surprising that the Japanese drama should be so well worthy of its people. The theatre has reached its present development slowly and with difficulty. Caste distinctions hindered its rise, actors ranking next the <em>eta</em>, or outcast class in feudal days, and the playhouses of such degraded beings lying under ban. Only the middle and lower classes patronized them, nobles never attending any public exhibitions, and all women being excluded.<br>&#x3000;In the golden age of the Tokugawas the drama began to win recognition; theatres were built by the Shogun ; the marionette shows, the first departure from the No Kagura, gave way to living actors and realism succeeded. In the great social upheaval and rearrangement of classes following the Restoration, actors rose a little in social esteem and gained some rights of citizenship. But an other quarter of a century will hardly rank the dramatic with the other arts and honor its interpreters. Noble men now attend the theatre, but actors never receive an invitation to their clubs. A few years since, Tokio (p.97) founded an association for the improvement of the theatre, and the development of the histrionic art of the country in its own distinctive way. Viscount Hijikata and Viscount Kawawa were elected president and vice-president of this Engei Kyokai, but little is known of its actual work.<br>&#x3000;Instead of farce or recitative prologue preceding the play, come one or two acts of classic pantomime or character dance, or an interlude of this kind in the middle of the drama. These classic pantomimes resemble the No Kagura simplified.<br>&#x3000;This No dance, or lyric drama, is the dramatic form cur rent before the seventeenth century. Bordering on the religious, it suggests the Greek drama, and the passion and miracle plays of mediaeval Europe. Originally, the No was the pantomime festival dance of the Shinto temples, fabled to have been first performed by Suzume be fore the cave of the Sun Goddess. The sacred dance is still a temple ceremonial, and the dances of the Shinto priestesses at Nikko and Nara are famous. In time the No became the entertainment of honor in the yashikis of the great, and princes and nobles took part in the solemn measures when greater princes were their guests. To the slow and stately movements of the dancers, and their play with fan and bells, dialogue was added, and an exaggeration of detail and etiquette.<br>&#x3000;The No is wholly artificial, the movements of the act ors being as stiff, stilted, and measured as the classic idiom in which the dialogue is spoken, and the ancient and obsolete ideographs which set forth the synopsis of the action. Confined to the yashikis and monasteries, the No was the entertainment of the upper classes, who alone could understand its involved and lofty diction and intricate symbolism. While the bare arguments of plays and dances are as familiar as fairy tales or folk lore, only scholars of great attainments can read their (p.98) actual lines, and the full translation of a No programme for the Duke of Edinburgh, on his visit to Japan, busied the interpreters of the British Legation for days, with the aid of all the old native poets and scholars in Tokio. The No is a trilogy, occupying four or five hours of three successive days. The first set of scenes is to propitiate the gods; the second to terrify evil spirits and punish the wicked ; and the third to glorify the good, beautiful, and pleasant. The <em>dramatis person&#xE6;</em> are gods, goddesses, demons, priests, warriors, and heroes of early legend and history, and much of the action is allegorical. By a long gallery at the left the actors approach the elevated pavilion or platform of the stage, which is without curtain or scenery, and almost without properties. The audience sits upon the matted area surrounding the three sides of the stage. Flute, drum, and pipes play continuously, and a row of men in old ceremonial dress sit statuesque at one side of the stage, chanting and wailing the explanatory chorus throughout the performance. In the great scenes the actors wear masks of thin lacquered or gilded wood, and valuable collections of such ancient dance masks are preserved in temples and yashikis. The costuming is superb, the old brocade and cloth-of-gold garments showing the court costumes of centuries ago, and the great families and monasteries hold their ancient No costumes as chiefest treasures.<br>&#x3000;The actors enter at a gait that out-struts the most exaggerated stage stride ever seen, the body held rigid as a statue, and the foot, never wholly lifted, sliding slowly along the polished floor. These buckram figures, mov ing with the solemnity of condemned men, utter their lines like automata, not a muscle nor an eyelash moving, nor a flicker of expression crossing the unmasked countenance. Their tones are unspeakably distressing, nasal, high-pitched, falsetto sounds, and many performers have (p.99) ruined and lost their voices, and even burst blood-vessels, in the long-continued, unnatural strain of their recitatives. The children who take part equal the oldest members in their gravity and woodenness. In some delightful scenes the demons, with hideous masks and abundant wigs of long, red-silk hair, spread deliberate and conventional terror among the buckram grandees, and, stamping the stage wildly, leaping and whirling, relieve the long-drawn seriousness of the trilogy. It is only when the performers are without masks that the scene is recognized as intentionally a light and amusing farce, while the roars of the audience are elicited by stately, ponderous, and time-honored puns, and plays upon words that a foreigner cannot appreciate.<br>&#x3000;Fine representations of the No may be seen at the Koyokwan club-house in Tokio, and in the audiences one beholds all the bureaucracy, the court circles, and a gathering of aristocratic families not elsewhere to be en countered.</p>

<p>p.226<br>&#x3000;There is a sort of club-house in Tokyo called the Koyokan, or &#x201C; Red Maple-leaf Club,&#x201D; where the Tokyo Press Association, comprising the leading metropolitan journalists of all shades of politics meets socially once a month, and there on the occasion when I had the honour of being entertained by my fellow- journalists, a number of Kyoto dancers performed after dinner a series of old dances for us, exhibiting besides the characteristic Japanese charm, terpsichorean ability which would be applauded any where. But I am here speaking only of the dancing of the geisha.</p>

<p>p.192<br><strong>CHAPTER XV</strong><br>THEATRES WITHOUT SEATS<br>The most the ordinary globe-scorcher has to say for Japanese theatres is that they please the Japanese &#x2014;&#x2014; common Japanese. The good-class Japanese do not go to them. They go in for No-dances, which strike the scoffing European as very well-named; not being dances at all, but a sort of religious play, with posturing and singing and declamation. After reading the book of Mr Osman Edwards, one of the few Englishmen who understand Japanese, and therefore have a reason able chance of knowing what they are talking about, I am aware that I have not seen the white- label kind of No-dances, but only the inferior sort, which go on like the band at the Criterion while you eat your dinner. I should not appreciate the real article as a Japanese nobleman would. He does not expect to be amused by the No-dance; he takes pleasure in the minute fidelity to tradition with which every word and gesture is given. The (p.193) utmost excitement I should get out of it would be in looking out for mistakes, as I used to check with my Bible the texts which Canon Webb-Peploe gave from memory in his sermons. To me it would be an awful penance to have sat, like Mr Edwards, through a performance of five religious plays and three &#x201C; Mad-words,&#x201D; which is Japanese- English for farces. The five religious plays were called <em>A High Priest in Exile</em>, <em>A Burden of Love</em>, <em>The Sick Wife</em>, <em>Benkei at Sea</em>, and <em>The Earth Spider</em>. The three farces were <em>Possession by Poxes</em>, <em>The Six Jizo</em>, and <em>The Owl-Priest</em>. I have forgotten how long they took, but the poor Japanese used not to be satisfied unless their plays lasted the whole day and night; and it required an Act of Parliament to limit them to the mere nine hours, which they take at present.</p>

<p>p.7<br><strong>CHAPTER XIII</strong><br>THEATHE-GOING IN JAPAN<br>To the uninitiated traveller, theatre-going in Japan is the dullest thing in the world. But I was a good sight-seer, and did my duty by taking an eight-shilling box to see the famous Danjuro, whose real name was Mr Horikoshi Shu, in one of his most characteristic dramas; and by paying very heavily to witness the sacred &#x201C; iVb &#x201C; dance at the Maple Club in Tokyo. This dance, which, as the American said, is in the visitors&#x2019; eyes no dance at all, is the most ancient and classical of all Japanese plays, and until lately the only theatrical performance ever acted at the Emperor&#x2019;s court, or performed in the palaces of the nobility and great houses. I also enjoyed many of the most popular flower ballets, such as the Miyako-Odori (the famous cherry-feast at Tokyo), and other geisha dances, which, however, belong to quite another story, and must not be confounded with the serious national drama. If I had had the good fortune to (p.8) have read Mr Osman Edwards&#x2019;s marvellously lucid and interesting account of the Japanese drama in his book called Japanese Plays and Playfellows before I visited the theatre, I might probably have found the acting of the world-famous Danjuro most entertaining; but as I knew nothing at all about the subject, the Henry Irving of Japan was to me distinctly heavy.</p>

<p>p.398<br>&#x3000;This afternoon we were invited by the Educational Depart ment to a concert at the old Chinese college. The music was an old form known as kiblgaku, two hundred years old, and came from the Province of Bizen. The hall in which the concert was given had carpets and chairs; the chairs being arranged in three rows on the two sides of the hall, leaving an open space (p.399) in the middle. There were nearly two hundred people present, mostly Japanese, and among them were twenty teachers from the Female Normal School and Kindergarten. They were a fine-looking group of women. It was interesting to see how low and ceremoniously they bowed to one another as they met. &#x2026; (p.401)<br>&#x3000;A man performed one of the Japanese slow and dignified ceremonial dances; it was not exactly a dance, but a play in which a variety of gestures were made by stamping the foot, etc. It was interesting as illustrating an old style of play. The question constantly arose, &#x201C; Is this music in our sense of the word?&#x201D; It is, but widely unlike ours. The sober, passive countenances of the performers are never enlivened by a smile; there are no dilated nostrils nor sparkling eyes nor swings of the head as with our singers when inspired by the words. It seems impossible that they should feel any inspiration or thrill from the monotonous sounds. The nearest comparison I could make would be to an old man in our country, with no ear for music, alone in a woodshed, absent-mindedly trying to recall some slow-timed and rather dismal hymn tune. Now this impression is felt by one who frankly confesses that he knows nothing about it. We thought certain forms of Japanese pictorial art absurd: certain prints, for example, with startling violations of perspective; human figures whose femora would have the proportions of baseball bats, whose skeletons, if found, would be classed as new genera; and yet these pictures command the admiration of our artists. It may be that their (p.402) music will ultimately prove to have merits of which we get no hint at present.</p>

<p>p.213<br>&#x3000;June 15. Attended the parting dinner given to Professors Netto, Chaplin, and Houghton. The dinner was given in a new building at Shiba Park known as the Koyokwan, be longing to a club of Japanese. The rooms are very beautiful; wonderful bits of old wood-carving have been worked into the rooms in a very effective manner. The dinner was excellent as all good Japanese dinners are. Before we were through some old Japanese comic acting was introduced, one act being a man fighting the spirit of a mosquito. Koto players gave some curious music. (I was told by a Japanese that their word for music, literally translated, meant &#x201C; tone pleasure.&#x201D;) After dinner the geisha girls danced and sang and the same old jug gler that I saw here three years ago performed his tricks. When I came away a box was given me which contained cake and candy. The box, eight inches square, was made of thin white wood and a little handle to the cover was cut out of green (p.214) bamboo (fig. 613). (I was told by Takamine that the bam boo attained its growth in one year.)</p>

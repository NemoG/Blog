London: William Heinemann.</p>
<p>p.39<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;RELIGIOUS PLAYS<br>The traveller who witnesses a &#x201C;<em>No</em> Dance,&#x201D; hastily improvised for his amusement at the Maple Club of Tokyo, or who chances upon a pantomimic duologue in grotesque costume, rendered on a rough platform to divert the crowd before a temple at the matsuri &#x2014;&#x2014; half fair, half festival &#x2014;&#x2014; can really form no idea of the exquisite little dramas which for more than five centuries have been performed privately in the houses of Japanese nobles and are still enacted at rare intervals to an invited audience. The common term &#x201C;<em>No</em> Dance&#x201D; is rather misleading, since it only suggests the rhythmic posturing of the characters &#x2014;&#x2014; very graceful, it is true, and pregnant with meaning for the initiated &#x2014;&#x2014; but ignores other factors, such as the words, the story, and the music, which contribute quite as memorably to the total effect. Operetta will not do, since the choric strains, which stimulate attention and intensify emotion with their staccato accompaniment, are sub ordinate throughout. If, then, that may be styled a play which revolves on a single episode and relates to no more than three or four persons, a very close parallel lies between these and the religious plays of Europe. In both you find the same reverence for the (p.40) past, dictating the devout demeanour of actors and audience; in both a minute traditional interpretation, governing the diction, the action, and the dress; in both a perpetual association of the scenes depicted with sacred legends and the spirit world. But whereas Christianity yields one and the same drama, once in a decade, to the peasants of Oberammergau, the Shintoist Pantheon, sanctifying national history and full of deified heroes, appeals to both patriotic and religious instincts through the medium of an art sometimes immature but always refined.<br>&#x3000;The roots of this musical pantomime reach far back into mythological times. The figure of the Terrible Female of Heaven, stamping on an inverted tub to startle the Sun Goddess from her cave, is generally invoked on the threshold of inquiries into the origin of Kagura, or temple-dancing. Grotesque and venerable, it is not illuminating. More startling to me is the statement of a modern authority that &#x201C;in the eighth century, in the later period of the Nara dynasty and at the beginning of the Heian period, combining the Korean and the Chinese music with the native, a certain perfect form of Japanese music came to exist.&#x201D; To comprehend this &#x201C; perfect music,&#x201D; as rendered on drum, fife, and flute, esoteric education is required. But it may be admitted that certain Wagnerian effects of terror and suspense and tumultuous agitation are thumped and wailed into the auditor, while his ocular attention is absorbed by deliberate phantoms. Very deliberate are the phantom dancers, whether their theme be simple or complex. On the dancing stages at the Shinto temples of Ise and of Omi, on the four platforms of the Kasuga Temple at Nara, the subject was naturally mythological or had relation to the (p.41) temple&#x2019;s own history. Such songs as went with the dance were simple, short, and primitive. They would be heard at Court ceremonies, too, for the union of Church and State was close. They were sung by members of privileged families, who guarded and trans mitted from father to son the professional secrets of their &#x201C;perfect music.&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;However, the beginning of the Ashikaga period in the fourteenth century saw the corruption and development of a perfect germ into complex variety. Both sacred and secular rivalry contributed to this result. The Biwa-hoshi, blind priests and lute-players, who went from castle to castle of the Daimyos, singing Heike-monogatari, historical romances of warlike quality in prose and verse, opened new vistas of subject-matter, while Shirabyoshi, the refined and cultivated precursor of the comparatively modern geisha, extended both the scope and the significance of posture-dancing. The Kioku-mai, or memory- dance, came into vogue, being characterised by closer co-ordination of music and movement, while the accompanying song would often celebrate a romantic episode or a famous land scape. Many of these songs survive, embedded in the chorus of <em>No</em> texts; in fact, they may be regarded as the nucleus of <em>No</em> drama.<br>&#x3000;The Muromachi Shogunate witnessed the final transition from dance to drama, recitative and singing speeches and dramatis persona being superadded to the chorus. Kiyotsugu (who died in 1406) and his son Motokiyo (who died in 1455) are generally credited with this development. They belonged to the Yusaki family &#x2014; one of the four families who exercised hereditary management of the Nara stage. They held a small estate, and succeeded in winning the Shogun&#x2019;s (p.42) patronage for their Sarugaku or <em>No</em>, which became extremely popular at Court. Naturally enough, the choric songs became panegyrics of the reigning Shogun, and helped to embellish his Court pageants.<br>&#x3000;It is not believed that the actor-manager did more than prepare and conduct the <em>No</em>, in which music and dancing were still the chief features. The author was contented to remain anonymous, and that for good reasons. Intellectual light shone mostly in the monasteries during that dark age of feudal fighting. If the Buddhist monk could make of this aristocratic amusement a vehicle for Buddhist teaching, individual obscurity was a small price to pay for corporate influence. Therefore, while it cannot be stated as a fact that the famous priests Ikkiu and Shiuran wrote the finest No poetry, it is certain that yurei or ghosts and Buddhist exorcisers became very common characters on the <em>No</em> boards, while the chorus betrayed (as I am told) &#x201C;many deep conceptions of mystic religion.&#x201D; What higher compliment has ever been paid to art, dramatic or pictorial, than the struggles of priests and politicians to wield its influence? There is something pathetic in this aspect of the rivalry for Terpsichore&#x2019;s hand. At first she wore the red trousers of a Shinto priestess and was wooed by the Mikado. Then the Shogun came, a strong man armed, and with him she danced into the Buddhist camp.<br>&#x3000;The sixteenth century gave the final touch to this musical drama, which approximated more and more to secular plays without ever entirely losing its official character. The ghosts faded out, the Buddhist influence grew less marked, for it had to traverse the tyranny of Nobunaga, who patronised Christianity and destroyed the monasteries of Hiei-zan. But hence- (p.43) forward, as an aristocratic institution, the No was to retain its popularity, though since the sixteenth century none have been written. A programme is still extant on which the two greatest names in Japanese his tory, those of Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu, star the list of performers. The actors were treated as samurai, military retainers, though the performers in popular <em>shibai</em> (theatres) were held in contempt. In the latest specimens knighthood is the invariable theme, set to more various music and illustrated by more violent posturing.<br>&#x3000;Throughout the Tokugawa era (1 602-1 868) every Daimyo who could afford it maintained a troupe of <em>No</em> players to reproduce for his edification the thoughts and habits of mediaeval art. Old costumes, old masks, old music were faithfully preserved; no innovation of text or interpretation was allowed by the hereditary custodians and directors. And since the shock of the Restoration a reaction has set in, favouring their revival.<br>&#x3000;At present there are in Tokyo six troupes of <em>No</em> players, with a <em>repertoire</em> of from two to three hundred plays. These retain so firm a hold on cultured conservatives &#x2014; the younger generation finds them slow &#x2014; that Mr. Matsumoto Keichi, one of the leading publishers, is now issuing a series of one hundred and eighty-three illustrative colour prints &#x2014; <em>No no ye</em> &#x2014; whose fine drawing and delicately blent hues are as superior to the flamboyant aniline horror by which the Nihon-bashi print-seller advertises the newest blood- and-thunder melodrama as that itself is inferior to the aristocratically-nurtured <em>No</em>. Reproduced as faith fully as may be, the pictures of Mr. Kogyo will, I hope, impress the reader with the archaic simplicity and beauty of the original design, provided that he (p.44) have the gift of sympathetic intuition, so as to divine what tale of terror, what burden of grief, obscure to him, is yet manifest enough behind quaint mask and rigid gesture to the heirs of national hagiology. The solemnity and pathos of each dramatised incident in the life of hero or saint is emphasised by the time- honoured locutions of mediaeval Japanese, which of course convey by mere association, as Elizabethan English to us, the tone and atmosphere of dead centuries. Yet, independently of the musical old speech, so cumbrous and so courteous, it is impossible to miss the meaning of these tiny tragedies, enacted as they are by instinctive masters of gesticular eloqience. The writer was particularly fortunate in gaining admission to a series of <em>No</em> produced by the Umewaka company or society, which has this advantage over the other five organisations, diverging on points of textual accuracy and stage ritual, that it traces unbroken descent through its chief from the Kanza school of music appertaining to the Yusaki family of Nara. When Commodore Perry forced open the door of the East in 1854, hitherto closed for more than two hundred years to Western barbarians, Mr. Umewaka captained a little band of <em>No</em> players attached to the then all-powerful household of Keiki, the last of the Tokugawa Shoguns.<br>&#x3000;Then followed bloody civil war, the bombardment of Kago-shima and Shimonoseki, and the restoration of the Emperor to supreme power. The ex-Shogun immured himself, a private gentleman, in strict seclusion. His company of players was of course dis banded, but little by little, from rare representations in the houses of friends to more frequent revivals, consequent on growing fame, their erudite and (p.45) enthusiastic chief was able to found his present very nourishing society. One gentleman, an ex-Daimyo, presented the troupe with a large stage of polished pine from his dismantled castle; a second contributed a priceless store of plays in manuscript; Mr. Umewaka himself brought the best gift of all, profound and practical knowledge of the stage technique, which is curiously elaborate in spite of seeming simplicity, and bristles with professional secrets. The orchestra consisted on this occasion of a flute and two <em>taiko</em>, drums shaped like a sand-glass and rapped smartly with the open palm. At irregular intervals, timed no doubt by the exigencies of the text, the musicians emitted a series of staccato cries or wailing notes, which seemed to punctuate the passion of the player and insensibly tightened the tension of the auditor&#x2019;s nerves. In two rows of three on the right of the stage sat the chorus, six most &#x201C; reverend signiors &#x201C; in the stiff costume of Samurai, who intervened now and again with voice and fan, the manipulation of the latter varying with the quality of the strains assigned to the singers. In placid moments the fan would sway gently to and fro, rocked on the waves of quasi-Gregorian chanting, but, when blows fell or apparitions rose, it was planted, menacing and erect, like a danger- signal before the choralist&#x2019;s cushion. The musicians were seated on low stools at the back of the stage before a long screen of conventional design, in which green pines trailed across a gold ground, harmonising admirably with the sober blues and browns of their <em>kimono</em>.<br>&#x3000;A glance at the programme gave assurance of prolonged and varied entertainment, since no less than five religious plays and three <em>kiogen</em> (lit. mad words), (p.46) or farcical interludes, were announced in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Shunkwan, the High-Priest in Exile</em>.</li>
<li><em>Koi no Omone, the Burden of Love</em>.</li>
<li><em>Aoi no Uye, the Sick Wife</em>.</li>
<li><em>Funa Benkei, Benkei at Sea</em>.</li>
<li><em>Tsuchigumo, the Earth-Spider</em>.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x3000;<em>Kiogen</em>.</li>
<li><em>Kitsune-Tsuki, Possession by Foxes</em>.</li>
<li><em>Roku Jizo, the Six Jizo</em>.</li>
<li><em>Fukuro Yamabusshi, the Owl-Priest</em>.<br>&#x3000;By an hour before noon the audience, seated on cushions in little pews holding four or six persons, had composed itself to that air of thoughtful anticipation which I had hitherto associated with devotees of Ibsen or Wagner. Many peered through gold spectacles at the copies of the antique text, whose phraseology was not without difficulties even for the scholars and artists present; the women&#x2019;s faces were far graver and more thoughtful than one usually sees in the land of laughing <em>musum&#xE9;</em>; the prevailing grey and black worn by women and men suffered sporadic invasions of bright colour wherever you saw children settling, like human butterflies. For these, though their ears availed them little, could follow with won dering eyes the strange succession of gorgeous or terrible figures &#x2014;&#x2014; warriors and spectres and court-ladies &#x2014; evoked for their delight. The story of Shunkwan, however, was quite devoid of spectacular appeal. Exiled in 1177 with other rebellious priests by Kiyomori, the ruthless Taira chief, to Devil&#x2019;s Island (Kikai-gashima), he is discovered celebrating with his companions an oblation to Kumano Gongen and praying for speedy restitution (p.47) to his fatherland. Pitiful indeed is the case of these banished suppliants, who wear the blue-and-white hempen skirts of fishermen and whose penury is such that they are obliged to bring the god water instead of <em>sak&#xE9;</em>, sand instead of rice, and hempen fetters instead of white prayer-cord. Kumano Gongen hears and answers their petition. An imperial messenger arrives from Kyoto with a letter from the daughter of Shunkwan, announcing that the Son of Heaven, Lord of the Land of the Rising Sun, has been graciously pleased to recall his erring subjects, pardoning their offences and inviting their prayers for an expected heir to the throne. Beaming with grateful joy, the old man now scans the imperial man date more closely, only to find that his own name is omitted from the list of those forgiven. Yasugori and Moritsune will be taken, but he, Shunkwan, must be left. In vain do his fellow-exiles lament and protest; all know that the Son of Heaven&#x2019;s decree must be obeyed to the letter. Accordingly, the others embark, while their disappointed chief falls, speech less and hopeless, on the shore. A simple, poignant story! So touchingly interpreted, that the primitive and even ludicrous makeshifts of the mounting seemed hardly incongruous! The mooring and unmooring of the boat, for which the crudest parody in outline of rope and wood did duty, and the final embarkation (as represented in the picture) were gravely accomplished in complete immunity from ill-timed laughter; the messenger&#x2019;s grotesque <em>hakama</em>, elongated trousers, trailing a good yard behind the feet, that the wearer might seem to walk on his knees while about his master&#x2019;s business, provoked no smile; in fact, any trivial details and defects were swallowed up in the (p.48) prodigious earnestness of the actors. The part of Shunkwan was played by Mr. Umewaka himself with much pathos, depending entirely on tone, carriage, and gesture, since all facial expression is barred by the strict convention of playing the <em>No</em> in masks. While the presentation of spectres and supernatural beings must be facilitated by this custom, since many of the masks are masterpieces of imaginative skill, yet, where the interest is purely human, that illusion at which all drama aims is proportionately diminished. Now came the children&#x2019;s turn to laugh at the first of the <em>kiogen</em>, entitled <em>Kitsune Tsuki</em>, &#x201C; Possession by foxes.&#x201D; Most of the comical interludes deal with rustic stupidity or cunning, and all refer in some way to religious belief or practice. If one may judge by the ubiquity of his images, the fox is the most sacred animal in Japan. No shrines are so numerous as those of Inari, the rice-goddess, and before each stand two white foxes, with snarling lips and teeth clenched on a mysterious golden object, which completely baffled the curiosity of M. Loti, though later writers declare it to be no more than a key, symbolising the portal of wealth unlocked by divine favour. But Inari herself is completely eclipsed in popular awe by her attendant foxes. It is they who, if not propitiated, ruin the rice crop; they who have the power, like the weir-wolf, of assuming human shape and of &#x201C;possessing&#x201D; unfortunate beings, whose only chance of delivery lies in exorcism by a priest. In the case of the <em>kiogen</em> now presented this superstition had been turned to comical use. We learned that Farmer Tanaka had sent two of his men into the fields with rattles to scare away birds, laying on them many injunctions to beware of the daemonic fox, Kitsune, whose exploits had lately (p.49) made him the terror of that neighbourhood. The warning is but too effectual. So full are the watchers&#x2019; minds of the dread of fox-possession, that, when their master appears with a jug of <em>sak&#xE9;</em> in his hand as a reward and refreshment after labour, they believe him to be Kitsune, the tempter, and thrash him soundly out of his own rice-field! Some have asserted that love, the romantic and chivalrous love of Western literature, is absent alike from the art and letters of Japan. Nevertheless, what could be more romantic than the title and plot of the play, attributed to the Emperor Gohanazono though signed by Motokiyo &#x2014;&#x2014; &#x201C;Koi no Omoni,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Burden of Love&#x201D;? The lover is Yamashina Shoji, an old man of high birth, but miserably poor, to whom out of charity has been entrusted the tending of the Emperor&#x2019;s chrysanthemums. A court-lady, seen by chance one day as he raised his head from the flowers, inspires a passion which he feels to be beyond hope or cure. He confides his unhappiness to one of the courtiers, who counsels him to carry a burden round and round the garden many times, until, haply, the lady &#x201C;seeing, may relent.&#x201D; This he does. At first the burden seems light as air, being buoyantly borne, but gradually it grows heavier and heavier, until at last he staggers to the ground, crushed to death by unavailing love. Soon after his ghost appears, a melancholy spectre with long white hair and gown of silver-grey, with wattled staff and eyes of hollow gold. At this point all chivalry certainly vanishes, for the angry apparition stamps and glares, and, shaking locks and staff, stoutly chides the beauty for her callous cruelty. The lady does not once intervene, but throughout the piece sits motionless, a figure rather than a person, her eyes fixed on the burden (p.50) itself, as it lies, concrete and symbolic, wrapped in apple-green brocade, near the front-centre of the stage. This inclusion of a significant silent object among the <em>dramatis persona</em> is curiously effective. The sight of Yamashina tottering beneath a physical weight would have made clumsy prose of a beautiful poetic truth. His feelings are better conveyed by the dirge-like song and lugubrious posturing, which poverty of language compels one to miscall a &#x201C;dance.&#x201D; Full of dignity and fine gesture is the ghost&#x2019;s rebuke. Slowly revolving on his heels, or tossing back his streaming, silvery hair, now dashing his staff upon the ground, now raising his kimono sleeve slowly to hide his face, one felt that this weird figure was expressing elemental passion in a language more elemental than speech. I cannot say as much for the lady, whose coronet of thin gold with silver crescent in front and pendent pagoda-bells on either side, surmounting a mask of singular ugliness, seemed the fantastic headpiece of a crude idol very foolishly idealised. But it served to illustrate, with an irony which the imperial author had not intended, the so grievous &#x201C;burden of love.&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;Kyoto court-life of the twelfth century, painted for posterity in the famous, interminable pages of &#x201C;Genji Monogatari,&#x201D; one of the oldest achievements of the lady-novelist, has found less tedious and equally faithful presentment in such dramatic miniatures as &#x201C;Aoi no Uye,&#x201D; Prince Genji&#x2019;s long-suffering wife. Jealousy is the keynote of this lyrical play &#x2014; that insatiable, self-torturing jealousy which is the hardest of demons to expel. Again I noticed a piece of curious, silent symbolism. The poor, demoniac wife, who gives her name to the play, does not appear, either as person or figure: in her stead a long strip of folded brocade, (p.51)</li>

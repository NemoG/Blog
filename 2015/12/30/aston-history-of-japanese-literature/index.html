        <span itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>CHAPTER III</strong><br>POETRY &#x2014; THE NO OR LYRICAL DRAMA - KIOGEN OR FARCE</p>
<p>p.197<br>&#x3000;The manufacture of Tanka at the court of the Mikado proceeded, as usual, during these periods of Japanese history. They were duly collected into anthologies from time to time; but as they present no features specially worthy of notice, and as they are admittedly much inferior in merit to the verse of earlier times, it is needless to dwell upon them here. A far greater interest belongs to a new development of the poetic art which now demands our attention, namely, the No or lyrical drama.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;Like the ancient Greek tragedies and the mystery plays of the Middle Ages, the drama in Japan was in its beginnings closely associated with religion. Its immediate parent was the Kagura, a pantomimic dance, which is performed at this day to the sound of fife and drum at Shinto festivals, on a platform provided for the purpose. The antiquity of the Kagura may be inferred from the fact that when the <em>Kojiki</em> (A.D. 712) and the <em>Nihongi</em> (A.D. 720) were written, there was already a myth current which was intended as an explanation of its origin. The Sun Goddess, it is related, disgusted at the unseemly pranks of her brother Susa-no-wo, shut herself up in the rock-cave of heaven and left (p.198) the world to darkness. Upon this the gods assembled in their myriads in the dry bed of the River of Heaven (the Milky Way), and among other expedients which they devised for luring her out of her retirement they caused Ame-no-Uzume (the Terrible Female of heaven) to array herself in a fantastical manner, and standing on an inverted tub, which gave out a hollow sound when she stamped on it, to perform a mimic dance which had the desired effect.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;The same works give elsewhere a story which was meant to supply an explanation of another pantomime which was performed in the Mikado&#x2018;s palace by the Hayato or guards. It runs as follows: &#x2014; There were two brother deities, the elder of whom, Ho-no-Susori, was a hunter, and the younger, Hiko Hohodemi, a fisherman. The two brothers having quarrelled, the younger used against his brother a talisman given him by his father-in-law, the God of the Sea, by virtue of which the tide rose and submerged Ho-no-Susori. The latter then begged for pardon, and promised to be his brother&#x2018;s bonds man and mime to all generations ; whereupon, by the power of another talisman, the tide retired and his life was spared. The younger brother was the ancestor of the Mikados, and the elder of the Hayato, who in memory of this were accustomed to perform a dance, in which the drowning struggles of Ho-no-Susori were imitated. The actors were naked to the waist-cloth, and smeared their hands and faces with red earth; reminding us of the wine-lees of Thespis and his crew.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;There is frequent mention in subsequent Japanese history of pantomime performances, some of which (p.199) were secular, and others of a more or less sacred character.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;When the dance and music of the Kagura were supplemented by .1 spoken dialogue, the No were the result. The addition of words is said to have been suggested by the chanted recitations of the <em>Heike Monogatari</em> by itinerant bonzes, and there is much in the language of the N6 to countenance this supposition. It is certain that the authors were well acquainted with it, and also with the <em>Gempei Seisuiki</em> and the <em>Taiheiki</em>.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;The beginnings of the No date from the fourteenth century. They were at first purely religious performances, intended to propitiate the chief deities of the Shinto religion, and were acted exclusively in connection with their shrines. At Ise, the principal seat of the worship of the Sun Goddess, there were three No theatres, in Omi three, in Tainba three, and at Nara four, all devoted to the service of the respective Shinto gods worshipped in these places.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;In the early part of the Muromachi period a manager of one of the No theatres at Nara, named Kwan-ami Kiyotsugu, attracted the notice of the ruling Shogun, who, for the sake of his art, took him into his immediate service. It is a noteworthy circumstance, as indicating the social position of the No performers, that this Kwan-ami was a small daimio, holding a fief in the province of Yamato. He died in 1406. From this time forward the No were under the special patronage of the Shoguns, just as the Tanka found favour and official protection at the court of the Mikado. Kiyotsugu was succeeded by his eldest son Motokiyo, who died in 1455, in his eighty-first year. Their descendants enjoyed the favour of the Shoguns (p.200) for a long period. Hideyoshi, who was Shogun in all but name, was very fond of the No, and is said to have taken part in them as an actor. Several of the more recent date from his time. In the Yedo period the Shoguns gave great attention to No performances. They were made a ceremony of state, and were acted by young gentlemen of the military class educated specially for this profession. Even at the present day there are some remains of their former popularity with the Samurai. Representations are still given in Tokio, Kioto, and other places, by the descendants or successors of the old managers who founded the art five hundred years ago, and are attended by small but select audiences composed almost entirely of ex-Daimios or military nobles and their ex-retainers. To the vulgar the No are completely unintelligible.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;Of the two hundred and thirty-five No contained in the latest and most complete collection (the <em>Yo-kyoku Tsuge</em>), no fewer than ninety-three are assigned to Se-ami Motokiyo, the second of the line of official managers; his father, Kwan-ami Kiyotsugu, being credited with fifteen. Motokiyo&#x2018;s son-in-law and successor has twenty-two assigned to him, those of the remainder which are not anonymous being distributed among a dozen or so of the subsequent holders of the office. The great majority belong to the fifteenth century.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;The <em>Yo-kyoku Tsuge</em> editor suggests, with great probability, that although the names of Kiyotsugu, Motokiyo, and their successors are given as authors of the No, they were in reality only responsible for the music, the pantomimic dance (the &#x201C;business,&#x201D; as we might say), and the general management. He surmises that the libretto was the work of Buddhist monks, to which class almost all (p.201) the literary men of this period belonged. The question of authorship is, however, of minor importance, as the characteristics of the No are rather those of a school of writers than of individuals.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;Whoever their authors may have been, their primary object was the promotion of piety. In some cases a patriotic or martial enthusiasm is the inspiring motive, and a love of nature is discernible in almost all, but the staple material is the mass of legends associated with the Buddhist and Shinto religions. A monk or guardian of a Shinto shrine is most frequently the chief personage of the play, and the virtue of hospitality to the priestly order, the sin of taking away life, the praise of particular deities, the uncertainty of life, and the transitoriness of human things are favourite themes with them.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;In the No, next after religion comes poetry. Not that they are exactly poems. Purely lyrical passages are not wanting, but much, both from the point of view of metre and of diction, is undeniable prose. Not a little is in an intermediate style, in which the seven and five syllable phrases succeed one another with great irregularity, and the language is alloyed with a less poetic element. The admission of Chinese words, although in moderation, also tends to lower the poetic level. It will be remembered that these are rigorously excluded from the older classical poetry.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;A very striking feature of the No is the lavish use which they make of the poetic devices mentioned in a previous chapter. [Footnotes: See above, p,32.] Pillow-words are freely introduced, and parallelism is a common ornament. But the greatest favourite of all is the &#x201C; pivot-word,&#x201D; which is employed in the No to an extent and in a manner previously unknown to (p.202) Japanese literature. This must be my excuse for dwelling on it at somewhat greater length here. &#x201C;The Pivot&#x201D; (I quote from Mr. Chamberlain&#x2019;s <em>Classical Poetry of the Japanese</em>) &#x201C;is a word of two significations, which serves as a species of hinge on which two doors turn, so that while the first part of the poetical phrase has no logical end, the latter part has no logical beginning. They run into each other, and the sentence could not possibly be construed.&#x201D; Mr. Chamberlain adds that &#x201C;to the English reader such a punning invention will doubtless seem the height of misapplied ingenuity. But, as a matter of fact, the impression produced by these linked verses is delightful in the extreme, passing as they do before the reader like a series of dissolving views, vague, graceful, and suggestive. This ornament especially characterises the old poetic dramas, and renders them a peculiarly arduous study to such as do not thoroughly appreciate its nature.&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;Native critics would no doubt endorse Mr. Chamber lain&#x2019;s favourable opinion of the pivot-word, and it is undeniable that the Japanese, who are an eminently nimble-witted race, delight in these acrobatic feats of language. But the English student will ask whether it is worth while to sacrifice sense and syntax for the sake of such inane, if sometimes pretty, antics. I venture to think that the &#x201C;pivot&#x201D; is a mistake in serious com position, and that the partiality for such a frivolous ornament of style manifested not only by the writers of No, but by the dramatists and novelists of the Yedo period, is a characteristic sign of an age of literary decadence and bad taste. Such writers as Hakuseki, Kiuso, and Motoori disdain it utterly. The authors of the No do not pique themselves on originality. They are in the habit of conveying to their</p>
